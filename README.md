# Saving Transformable Types Using Core Data
## Transformable : 
 Core Data allows us to store integers, booleans, strings, UUID, date, etc. but sometimes we want to store a specific data type like UIColor, UIImage, our own class, struct, or enum, and even arrays, but that is simply not an option in Attributeâ€™s Type.Transformable property type which allows us to store custom data types as an object of the declared attribute for a record of an Entity. The only requirement is that our custom type should conform to NSCoding or we need to provide a custom value transformer.

## Sample Code 
### Fetch all data from Core Data by SwiftUI  
@FetchRequest(entity: Room.entity(),sortDescriptors: [], predicate: nil, animation: nil) var allRooms : FetchedResults<Room>

### Way to transform between NSColor to Data 
 guard let color = value as? NSColor else { return nil }
        do{
            let data = try? NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: color, requiringSecureCoding: true)
            return data
        }catch{
           return nil
        }
        
        
  ### Way to transform from Data to NSColor
 guard let data = value as? Data else { return nil }
        do{
            let color = try? NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchivedObject(ofClass: NSColor.self, from: data)
            return color
        }catch{
           return nil
        }
